# teacher-race
In this school project different types of teachers participate in a race. 
There are different vehicles and routes to choose from. 
Also, every teacher will get randomized acceleration and reaction times depending on their type.
Teachers are devided into 3 types: "Theoretiker" (theorist), "Praktiker" (practicians) and "Normalos" (normals). 
Theorists have a high acceleration but a long reaction time. 
Practicians have a low accerlation but therefore a short reaction time.
